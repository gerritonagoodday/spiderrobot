# Intro

This is my first foray into robotics after a considerable time away from real-time process control systems and embedded development of ca. 30 years. This is a prototype 8-legged spider with 2 pincers, 2 cameras for eyes, moving vision, and a mandible with pointy teeth to scare the little children, all made mode LEGO Technic. The MCU is an ESP32 Dev module, and software is written in C++ (none of this interpreted Python stuff here) for the FreeRTOS O/S, using PlatformIO on Visual Code as the development environment, on a Linux machine, because developing it on Windows would just be painfull. 

Initially most of the code will be experimental in nature and not much use to anyone, but the pictures may tempt you to start building or improving your own LEGO Spider Robot. Suggestions welcome.
